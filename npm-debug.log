29 silly publish   readme: 'tallyup\n=======\n\nTallyup is a simple stats, ratings, generic command processing and aggregation server similar to statsd. Tallyup includes the server for starting things up (tallyupd) and a management server for issuing simple commands to determine the state of things. Tallyup also has the ability to flush to listeners. In short, tallyup is a network daemon that runs in Node.js sent over TCP (instead of UDP).\n\nInspiration\n-----------\n\nTallyup was inspired by statsd and has some basic implementation differences with relation to aiming for stream reuse, code separation, management cli, command line configuration, and generic command processing (which can be later used for extensible process handlers).\n\nInstallation and Configuration\n------------------------------\n\n```\nnpm install -g tallyup\n```\n\nOnce you\'ve installed via the above command, you should have both**tallyupd** and **tallyup-cli** available from your local bin environment. Additional usage can be found via **tallyupd --help** or**tallyup-cli --help**.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe basic line protocol is identical to statsd sent via TCP.\n\n```\n<metricname>:<value>|<type>\n```\n\nYou can send a simple metric from command line using something like nc.\n\n```\necho "movie:3|rate" | nc 127.0.0.1 8711\n```\n\nTypes\n-----\n\n### Counting\n\nSimilar to statsd, a counter will add the amount to the bucket. At each flush interval the current count is sent and reset to 0.\n\n```\nrequests:1|incr\n```\n\n### Aggregates\n\nAggregates are automatically calculated for various items. For instance, if you perform the **incr** command type, then a counter is tracked as well as the aggregate sum long term. This allows us to keep track of the rate per second of a given counter, flush counts over time, and store the total amount for a key.\n\n### Ratings\n\nRatings are useful for keeping track of a value that might be within a range of static ratings. For instance, if you are tracking the ratings on products or movies, you can use this type to keep track of the**aggregate** number of ratings supplied to a key, the aggregate average rating, the **aggregate** of all the rating values, as well as the ratings per second as tracked by **counters**.\n\n```\nmovieid:3|rate\n```\n\ntallyup-cli usage\n-----------------\n\ntallyup-cli provides a simple cli that will connect to the management server for a given tallyupd server. Commands are available via **help**. You should be able to see current **ratings**, **info**, **counters**, and **aggregates**.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Thomas Holloway Licensed under the MIT license.\n',
